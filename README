This directory holds various Etched Pixels model railway projects that I'm
releasing under non-commercial licenses as I wind the business down.

Unless otherwise indicated in the licensing files with the specific module
these files are licensed CC-NC-BY-SA 4.0

https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/

If you are a model railway club or society or working on something where you
would like to use it commercially please contact me and we can sort something
out.

Note that these files are provided without warranty. Also some of them that
were never released as products have not really been tested beyond some initial
prints.

For the CC-SA requirement please identify the models and files as "Designed by
Alan Cox" or if modified "Based upon a design by Alan Cox".

It is the intention of the rights holder that this license controls the
modification and printing of the model, not further activities and changes made
post printing.

If for example you wish to offer services completing, detailing, decorating
and finishing models produced from these prints as a commercial service it is
not the intention of this licence to prevent you from doing so providing that
either

- The customer provides the printed model
- The customer has free access to the files needed to print the model but
  chooses to let you print it, and for the printing of the model you charge
  no more than the actual cost. (What you charge for services beyond that
  is your own business)
