This is an unfinished project to build a Metrovick CO-BO. OpenSCAD is a crazy
way to do this so if you want to finish it I'd strongly suggest rendering it
in OpenScad and importing the STL into a more appropriate tool.

Some of the pieces are provided in both xcf and scad format. A tool generates
one from the other but isn't yet releaseable. The scad files should be fine
given you'd want to import the file into a 3D design tool anyway.
